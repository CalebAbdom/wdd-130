      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> Showcase my skill set and eventually land a job to better expose me as a better developer as well as Building a website for small bussiness and individuals that need a website to promote their producs or services and to connect with potential customers. </p>
      <p>Having a personal website is becoming increasingly important in today’s digital age. It’s a great way to showcase your set of skills, experience, and projects to potential clients or employers, In this paragraph I will include some of the key components that I believe it should be included on a personal website and make it mine.
        Homepage is probably the most important part. The first thing that visitors will see Includes a brief introduction about myself, my skills and experience, and a link to my portfolio. Answering the question: “Why will people come to my site?” My purpose on being on the internet could be the reason, I am not the most popular kid or the smart one but my passion and credibility are easy to read since I care about the final product and most importantly, satisfying my customers’ needs, expanding horizons and showing creativity on the process.
        Portfolio: This is where you will showcase your best work. (this can be a great way to share my passion in words and my work philosophy) and potentially answer all questions related to my work as aesthetics and customizations.
        This is a great way to showcase my web development skills and experience to potential clients or employers in the future. I can include my resume, past projects, and testimonials from previous clients and/or work(homework)assigments that were done with excellence.
        A blog about web development is a thought-on process because I can communicate differently with my viewers and most likely other developers. This is a great way to share my knowledge and expertise with others and to establish myself as a thought leader in the field. I can write about new technologies, trends, and best practices in web development. (I may also want to include a brief description of each project, including the technologies used and the challenges you faced).
        A landing page for my web development services. This is simple and it can be on the “contact me” page but it also outlines my services and pricing. I could also include a contact form with social media pages (professional) so that potential clients can get in touch with you.
        I am excited about this activity and I am sure it will take energy and time but it will be something I will use for a long time. A personal portfolio working as a website is a must for web developers. Also important to keep it all up to date with new projects as work or a blog post to stay relevant in the industry.
